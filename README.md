```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SiakadFor06 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        double score, highest = 0, lowest = 100;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) { 
            System.out.print("Enter score for student " + i + ": "); 
            score = sc.nextDouble(); 
            if (score > highest) { 
                highest = score; 
            } 
            if (score < lowest) { 
                lowest = score; 
            } 
        } 
        System.out.println("Highest score: " + highest); 
        System.out.println("Lowest score: " + lowest); 
    }
}
```

#### 2.1.3 Questions
* **Question 1:** Identify and indicate each component of the FOR loop in the program code of Experiment 1!
* **Question 2:** Why is the variable highest initialized to 0 and the variable lowest initialized to 100? What happens if highest is initialized to 100 and lowest is initialized to 0? 
  * **Answer:** The variable highest is initialized to 0 and lowest to 100 because the program is designed to read scores that are expected to be in the range of 0 to 100. This way, the first score entered will automatically replace these starting values if it is higher or lower than them. If highest were initialized to 100 and lowest to 0, the program would start with the wrong comparison values, so it could fail to detect the actual maximum and minimum correctly, and the final output would be wrong.
* **Question 3:** Explain the function and workflow of the following code snippet!
![](/CodeSnipped.png)
  * **Answer:** This snippet compares each entered score with the current highest and lowest values. If score > highest, then the score is larger than the previous maximum, so it replaces highest with the new value. If score < lowest, then the score is smaller than the previous minimum, so it replaces lowest with the new value. In other words, this code continuously updates the highest and lowest scores as new values are entered, so after all inputs are processed, the variables store the maximum and minimum scores from the set.
* **Question 4:** Modify the program to count how many students pass and how many students fail, based on the passing threshold (minimum score of 60). Display the number of students who pass and fail after displaying the highest and lowest scores!  
  * **Answer:**
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SiakadFor06 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        double score, highest = 0, lowest = 100;
        int passCount = 0, failCount = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) { 
            System.out.print("Enter score for student " + i + ": "); 
            score = sc.nextDouble(); 
            if (score > highest) { 
                highest = score; 
            } 
            if (score < lowest) { 
                lowest = score; 
            } 
            if (score >= 60) {
                passCount++;
            } else {
                failCount++;
            }
        } 
        System.out.println("Highest score: " + highest); 
        System.out.println("Lowest score: " + lowest); 
        System.out.println("Number of students who pass: " + passCount);
        System.out.println("Number of students who fail: " + failCount);
    }
}

### 2.2  Experiment 2: Student Grades Case Study in SIAKAD – WHILE Loop

#### 2.2.1 Java Code
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class siakadwhile06 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        double score;
        int studentCount, i=0;
        
        System.out.print("Enter the number of students: "); 
        studentCount = sc.nextInt();

        while (i < studentCount) { 
            System.out.print("Enter score for student " + (i + 1) + ": "); 
            score = sc.nextInt(); 
 
            if (score < 0 || score > 100) { 
                System.out.println("Invalid score. Please enter a valid score!"); 
                continue; 
            } 
 
            if (score > 80 && score <= 100) { 
                System.out.println("The grade of student " + (i + 1) + " is A"); 
            } else if (score > 73 && score <= 80) { 
                System.out.println("The grade of student " + (i + 1) + " is B+"); 
            } else if (score > 65 && score <= 73) { 
                System.out.println("The grade of student " + (i + 1) + " is B"); 
            } else if (score > 60 && score <= 65) { 
                System.out.println("The grade of student " + (i + 1) + " is C+"); 
            } else if (score > 50 && score <= 60) { 
                System.out.println("The grade of student " + (i + 1) + " is C"); 
            } else if (score > 39 && score <= 50) { 
                System.out.println("The grade of student " + (i + 1) + " is D"); 
            } else {

#### 2.2.3 Questions
* **Question 1:** IIn the following code snippet, determine the meaning and purpose of the following syntax:
```
if (score < 0 || score > 100) { 
System.out.println("Invalid score. Please enter a valid score!"); 
continue; 
}
```
  * **Answer:**
    The syntax if (score < 0 || score > 100) { System.out.println("Invalid score. Please enter a valid score!"); continue; } means: if the score is less than 0 or greater than 100, it is invalid, so the program prints an error message and immediately skips the rest of the current loop iteration using continue. Its purpose is to prevent invalid input from being processed and to force the user to enter a correct score before continuing to the next student. The expression in part:
    
    (a) is score < 0 || score > 100, which means “score is below 0 or above 100,”
    
    (b) continue tells the loop to stop the current iteration and go back to the loop condition.
* **Question 2:** Why is the i++ statement written at the end of the WHILE loop? What happens if it is written at the beginning of the WHILE loop?
  * **Answer:**
    The i++ statement is written at the end of the while loop so that each time a valid student score is entered and processed, the counter increases by 1. This keeps track of how many students have already been handled and ensures the loop eventually stops when i reaches studentCount. If i++ were written at the beginning of the loop, the loop would skip the first student because i would increase before checking or processing the score, causing the program to count incorrectly and possibly stop too early.
* **Question 3:** If the number of students entered is 19, how many times will the WHILE loop run?  
  * **Answer:**
    If the number of students entered is 19, the while loop will run 19 times, because the loop condition is while (i < studentCount), so it repeats until i reaches 19. Each valid student input increases i by 1, and the loop stops when i becomes 19.
* **Question 4:**Modify the program so that, if a student receives grade A, the program displays an 
additional message “Well done, keep up the good work!”  
  * **Answer:**

### 2.3 Experiment 3: Café Transaction Case Study – DO-WHILE Loop

#### 2.3.1 Java Code
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class cafeDoWhile06 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int coffee, tea, bread, totalPrice;
        int coffeePrice = 12000, teaPrice = 7000, breadPrice = 20000;
        String customerName;
        do { 
            System.out.print("Enter customer name (type 'cancel' to exit): "); 
            customerName = sc.nextLine(); 
            if (customerName.equalsIgnoreCase("cancel")) { 
                System.out.println("Transaction canceled."); 
                break; 
            } 
            System.out.print("Coffee quantity: "); 
            coffee = sc.nextInt(); 
            System.out.print("Tea quantity: "); 
            tea = sc.nextInt(); 
            System.out.print("Bread quantity: "); 
            bread = sc.nextInt(); 
            totalPrice = (coffee * coffeePrice) + (tea * teaPrice) + (bread * breadPrice); 
            System.out.println("Total amount to pay: Rp " + totalPrice); 
            sc.nextLine(); 
        } while (true); 
 
        System.out.println("All transactions completed."); 
        
    }
}
```

![Example Image of Experiment 3 Output](/coffeeCust.png)

#### 2.3.3 Questions
* **Question 1:** In this DO-WHILE loop, if the first customer name entered is “cancel”, how many times is the loop executed?
  * **Answer:** The loop runs once. A do-while loop executes its body before checking the condition. Since the first name is “cancel,” the break statement exits the loop during that first execution.
* **Question 2:** State the stopping condition used in this DO-WHILE loop! 
  * **Answer:** The loop’s condition is while (true), which is always true. In practice, the loop stops when the customer enters “cancel” and the break statement runs.
* **Question 3:** What is the function of using the value true in the DO-WHILE condition? 
  * **Answer:** true makes the loop repeat indefinitely unless it is exited another way, such as with the break statement.
* **Question 4:**Why does this DO-WHILE loop still run even though it has no initialization and update components?   
  * **Answer:** A do-while loop does not require initialization or update components like a for loop. It executes its body, checks its condition, and repeats while the condition is true. Here, the loop is controlled by while (true) and exits through break when the customer enters “cancel”.

## 3: Assignment 

The following is a list of tasks performed on this Jobsheet:

- [x] **Task 1:** A cinema manager wants to create a program to calculate the total ticket sales in one 
day. Tickets are sold at Rp 50,000 per ticket. The program must calculate the total number 
of tickets sold and the total ticket sales revenue for the day, subject to the following rules:

    • If a customer buys more than 4 tickets, the customer receives a 10% discount. 

    • If a customer buys more than 10 tickets, the customer receives a 15% discount. 

    • If the ticket quantity entered is invalid (negative), the program ignores the input and 
      asks for it to be re-entered.
      
- [x] **Task 2:** Refer to the following flowchart!
      A parking lot operator wants to create a program to calculate the total parking fees of 
several vehicles. The parking rate is Rp 3,000 per hour for cars and Rp 2,000 per hour for 
motorcycles. The program keeps asking for input as long as the input is not 0. Implement 
the flowchart as a Java program! 

### 3.1 Task Code Implementation

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ticketSale {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int TICKET_PRICE = 50000;
        int customerCount, totalTickets = 0;
        double totalRevenue = 0;

        System.out.print("Enter the number of customers: ");
        customerCount = sc.nextInt();

        for (int i = 1; i <= customerCount; i++) {
            int quantity;
            do {
                System.out.print("Enter the number of tickets for customer " + i + ": ");
                quantity = sc.nextInt();
                if (quantity < 0) {
                    System.out.println("Invalid quantity. Please enter a non-negative number.");
                }
            } while (quantity < 0);

            double discountRate = 0;
            if (quantity > 10) {
                discountRate = 0.15;
            } else if (quantity > 4) {
                discountRate = 0.10;
            }

            totalTickets += quantity;
            totalRevenue += quantity * TICKET_PRICE * (1 - discountRate);
        }
        System.out.println("Total tickets sold: " + totalTickets);
        System.out.printf("Total ticket sales revenue: Rp %.0f%n", totalRevenue);
    }
}
```
